####



## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Update your Portis Wallet credentials in ```secrets.json``` in ethereum directory. Then, Compile and deploy contracts using truffle:

```bash
truffle migrate --network matic
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Problems we aim to solve:

Misinformation is a major problem in a world where there are many sources of information on the internet which may or may not provide the right information. This ultimately results in users losing faith in every internet source altogether.   

We aim to solve this problem of misinformation by means of crowd verification and independent source (News Organizations) verification of the news shared. We aim to incentivize people to provide right verdicts on each piece of information by allowing them to bet  on what they feel is correct. They receive their fair share of profits once the news is verified by the independent sources.

## Goals:

- To provide a trusted source of information.
- To incentivize and reward users for providing the right verdicts on each piece of information.
- To reduce spam and misinformation.
- To help users get news efficiently and effectively.

## Use cases:

- As a primary source of news on the current affairs.
- Generating personal profits.


## Technology Stack:

- ReactJS.
- NodeJS
- Solidity

## Packages used:

- Matic (For reducing the gas transaction fee and processing time).
- Portis (Seamless authentication).
- Truffle (for developement)
